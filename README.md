A diagnosis of kidney disease means that a personâ€™s kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood the way they should. Each year, kidney disease kills more people than breast or prostate cancer. In 2013, more than 47,000 Americans died from kidney disease. There are 5 stages of kidney disease, but in its early stages and can go undetected until it is very advanced. The overall prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population is approximately 14 percent and $50 Billion in Medicare was spent on CKD in 2013.

The data for this project was pulled from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It covers a two month period in India and has 400 observations across 25 features, and one classification variable (Y/N CKD). The data includes numeric, binary, and categorical features. There are just over 1,000 null values across all 25 features. White blood cell count and red blood count variables have the most nulls values with 105 and 130 observations respectively.

This project looks at the implementation of various shallow supervised learning models on the data. Model performance was judged on both dropped NA values and mean imputed values. Some models implemented include support vector machines, decision trees, ensemble learning, logistic regression, etc.
